**Basic Python Syntax and Indentation**

**1. Basic python syntax**
    **Case Sensitivity**
     Python is case-sensitive, meaning variable names must be consistent.

**2. Statements**
    Each line of code typically represents a statement.

 **3. Comments**
      The hash (#) symbol is used for single-line comments.

      The (""" """) triple quotes is used for docs strings as well as documentations.

**4. Variables**
      Python is dynamically typed and does not need to be declared explicitly.


**5. String Quotation**
     Strings are either enclosed in single('') or double quotes(").


**Indentation Guide**
    Use either tabs or spaces consistently for indentation (PEP 8 recommends 4 spaces per indentation level; do not mix tabs and spaces)
