## 🐍🐍 **Learning-Python-Full-Time**

This repository is my full documentation of learning python — from the basics to advanced concepts. It is a resource reinforced with syntax notes, examples, and real-world projects. These serves as a personal learning jounal and research resource for anyone walking the same path.



## ✔🎯 **Goals**
- Build a strong foundation in python programming.
- Reinforce concepts with examples and solved exercises.
- Apply knowledge through small to large-scale projects.
- Document and track progress for future references.
